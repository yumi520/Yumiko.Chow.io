        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The constant pursuit of internships, job applications, and 
            academic excellence can leave seniors and juniors little room to relax, 
            leading to a pervasive sense of burnout that permeates their final years on campus.

    <section class="sunneyThirdSection">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>I designed a mobile application where graduating seniors and juniors can focus on providing a break from 
            academic pressures and offering opportunities for self-expression and interest exploration.
