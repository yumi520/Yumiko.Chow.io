        <p>My immediate assumption on making Spotify social is to add a messaging feature.
            For social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, their main component revolves around
            having a messaging feature. With Tiktok, it allows users to send their friends reels quickly with just one tap. 
            Adding a messaging feature to Spotify could help people connect with their friends and share
            music easily.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, this was just a hypothesis. <mark className="highlight">I interviewed three young adukts users over Zoom and asked them all about
         their experiences. I was curious about what they enjoyed, their motivations for using social media/Spotify, and ultimately their
          pain/bright points so that I could devise a solution.</mark>
