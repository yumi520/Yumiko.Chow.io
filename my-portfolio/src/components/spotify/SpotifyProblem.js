        <p>
        Creating a platform for music lovers has its challenges.
         Matching users by music taste can be tricky due to varied preferences and limited data.
         Privacy is also a concern, as users may be reluctant to share their music preferences openly, fearing social embarrassment.
         To address this, strong privacy controls are needed so users can choose what to share or hide.
